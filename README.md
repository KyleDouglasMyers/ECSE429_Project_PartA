# ECSE429_Project_PartA

Welcome to Part A of the project for ECSE429!

The project repository is fairly simple, as it only covers todos since it is a 1 person project

You can download the project, and only run in the environment. if you wish to run it as a jar, more configuring might be needed, but you should be able to complie the test code. Doing so will turn on the application that is being tested as well, so no need to run thr runtTodoManager jar
